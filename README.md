# Fuel_efficiency_prediction
Fuel efficiency prediction using TensorFlow estimates a vehicle’s mileage based on features like engine size, weight, cylinders, and horsepower. A neural network regression model is trained on preprocessed data to learn patterns and accurately predict MPG, helping improve fuel economy and sustainable vehicle design.
